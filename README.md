# Web-Design-Challenge
In this web design, I have taken previously generated weather plot visualizations and data in order to produce a website that allows a user to gain a more visual and in-depth understanding of some of my previous work. 

## Technologies
The main scripting languages were HTMl and CSS, with the theme pulled from Bootswatch. Using VSCode as the main editing tool, I generated a total of 7 web pages that reference various htmls in order to produce the website. 

In order to achieve the appropriate color customizations and ids based on requirements I had for the page appearance, I directly updated the boostrap.css file for any formatting as required. 

In addition, in order to generate the cloud animation, I pulled a animation.css from online and and add in the css and html scripts as required. Then further adjusting the number of clouds that I wanted, the shape, speed, and size in which they populated on the webpages. 

## Folders
The Assets folder holds the additional .html files for each of the visualizations pages, the comparison page and data page. It also holds the css folder holding the necessary bootstrap.css that holds the theme and customizations that were made for the website. 

The Resources folder holds the cities.csv and python-generated html script required for the data.html page in order to generate the weather table.

The Visualizations folder holds the images used for each of the plot visualizations pages.

## Additional Notes
In order to run the html website, please reference the GitHub pages site: https://priyamittal96.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html. Conversely, if you would like to make any customizations to the website, download any necessary parts of the repo and adjust as required.
